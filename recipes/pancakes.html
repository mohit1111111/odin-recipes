    <h3>Discription</h3>
    <p>Pancakes are a classic breakfast food, but can also be enjoyed for brunch or even dessert. They are thin, round, and fluffy cakes made from a batter of flour, milk, eggs, and a leavening agent like baking powder. This leavening agent creates air bubbles in the batter, making the pancakes light and airy. Pancakes are typically cooked on a griddle or frying pan with butter or oil, and then served with sweet toppings like maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl; make a well in the center. Whisk together water and oil in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour oil and water into flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Stir just until blended; mixture will be lumpy.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle. Cook until bubbles form and edges are dry. Flip, then cook until bottoms are browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
        <li>Serve with berries.</li>
